# Breast-Cancer-Data-Dive
**Description:**

This Python project aims to analyze breast cancer data to understand factors influencing survival rates, treatment effectiveness, and the aggressiveness of cancer growths. By investigating factors like tumor stage, histology, surgery type, and receptor status (ER, PR, HER2), this project seeks to provide valuable insights for medical professionals and researchers.

**Objectives:**

* **Survival Analysis:**
  * Investigate the correlation between tumor stage, histology, and patient status (alive/dead).
  * Identify factors influencing survival rates.
* **Treatment Outcomes:**
  * Compare the effectiveness of different surgery types (Lumpectomy, Mastectomy, etc.) in terms of patient survival rates.
* **Investigating Aggressive Cancer Growth:**
  * Determine cancer aggressiveness based on ER, PR, and HER2 status.
  * Investigate cases with more aggressive cancer growth, considering histology and tumor stage.
  * Compare aggressive cases with varying levels of aggressiveness.
* **Investigating Mortality Rates:**
  * Compare mortality rates based on the stage of detection.
  * Identify which category has higher chances of survival after surgery.
